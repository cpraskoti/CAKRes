# CAKRes

## Introduction
This is a project by **CAKRes Innovations** that aims to improve workflow of research scientists in natural sciences. 
It aims to do so by producing real-world accurate upscaled image of low-resolution simulation of physical phenomenon.

Currently, the project to focuses on Super Resolution in the domain of Fluid Dynamics, with domain expansion in the future.

## Motivation
This project was motivated by a necessity in one of our labs. We drew inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/erichson/SuperBench).

## Resources
We are training our models using the following resources:

- 1x RTX4090
- 64 GB Memory
- 5 TB Storage
- Apache Spark cluster

## Benchmark
We might use [this benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14070).
