# CAKRes

## Introduction
This is a project by **CAKRes Innovations** that aims to improve workflow of research scientists in natural sciences. 
It aims to do so by producing real-world accurate upscaled image of low-resolution simulation of physical phenomenon.

Currently, the project to focuses on Super Resolution in the domain of Fluid Dynamics, with domain expansion in the future.

## Motivation
This project was motivated by a necessity in one of our labs. We drew inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/erichson/SuperBench).
